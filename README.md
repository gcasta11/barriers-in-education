# Barriers in Education

## By Gabriela Castaneda

## Abstract
Over the course of human history, it has been made more than clear that marginalized communities have and continue to face severe disparities that stems from systematic racism and xenophobia. The following presentation was made to show these racial disparities, how they prevent the progression of education in specifically Mexican-American communities, and how we are able to close this gap in education.
